Throughout this course, we were presented with 5 key questions:

#1: What happens to history as it gets digitized?

#2: what does history look like, 

#3: what happens to our materials

#4: What about the the stories we tell or the questions we ask as we abstract further and further away from ‘In Real Life’?

#5: What does ‘digital history’ really mean?

To answer all these questions, I will primarily be drawing upon what I haved in our digital history class and my experience as I worked through the four modules. Throughout the digital history course, we are constantly reminded that anything which is digitized are extremely susceptable to being altered and changed by anyone. This primarily poses the issue that this can be manipulated into an offensive way, swaying it away from the real history behind the object and instead made to reflect whatever the user desires. 

History is something that does not exist anymore. Whether it is lost through time or destroyed, the study of what is not there anymore is history. From this, history is also ever changing and constantly being created as new technology are constantly being developed, new discoveries are always being made and previous beliefs or concepts are altered as we have a more clear image of the past

Materials are something which we use to make something of greater significance. Perhaps the choice of material itself can have a stronger symbolism whicih works hand in hand with the intended artifact made or the choice of material are purely chosen due to it's durability and aesthetics. Over time, the material which we choose to create our artifact from will deteroriate and this is a physical representation of the passing of time and the way this artifact is treated. If we do choose to repair or replace various pieces of an artifact with a new material, this is significant as it demonstrates how much we value the artifact and possibly any new technology or development that was made since the original creation of the artifact

Due to the fact that once history becomes digitized, it is very easy to manipulate and the question if it still reflects real life can be brought up.
