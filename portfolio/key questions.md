Throughout this course, we were presented with 5 key questions:

#1: What happens to history as it gets digitized?

#2: what does history look like, 

#3: what happens to our materials

#4: What about the the stories we tell or the questions we ask as we abstract further and further away from ‘In Real Life’?

#5: What does ‘digital history’ really mean?

To answer all these questions, I will primarily be drawing upon what I haved in our digital history class and my experience as I worked through the four modules.
