This portfolio/reflection/whatever-you-call-it can be very personal, or it can try to be a formal piece of work. It should be something that you are proud to show someone else from outside this class: it will, after all, live on the open web (unless you have privacy concerns and have made an arrangement with me in this regard)

Throughout this digital history course, I have learned and achieved many things that I was not expected when I initially enrolled into this course. I remember when I first got the email from our professor Shawn Graham asking to create github and hypothesis accounts rather than simply posting everything on CULearn, I was immediately taken back. After reading the syllabus and trying to figure out what was required within this course and how we would be marked, I began to second guess myself. This course had sounded like a programing or technology class rather than a history course. I started to question whether I should have switched out into another class where I know I will be able to understand the work or simply stay, take my chance and hopefully the students who have previous knowledge about programming be kind enough to lend me a hand. 

After deciding to stick with the course, I was more than surprised that I was not the only student who had the same feeling as I had expected the class to be filled with individuals that are very good with software and programs. Not long after the class started, we were faced with our first module which was to create a 3D model based on something historical around Ottawa. Due to the fact that I have an Android S6, I decided to use the app called scanned3D. After many failed attempts in using this app, I decided to take my luck with Regard3D and this did not get me any further than my previous attempts. I was stumped as I have no knowledge about command prompts which was required to insert data into the image needed for Regard3D. As a shy fourth year student, I took my chances and spoke to the professor, perhaps he was kind enough to lend me a hand or even give me any extra resources needed. This was a miracle, I was taught step by step on what to type in for the command prompts after classs and I had handed in my first module in on time. While I certainly did not feel that I had done much besides mess with the program and take some pictures, I had a sense of happiness over me as this was the first time in my four year of university that I took up a challenge and created something which was not an essay nor a presentation.
