Throughout the four modules that was required within this course, I have documented my process, noted major themes that relate to what I create and all of this has left an over digital mark online. The first can be seen with the method in which all this is documented. Github could be made accessable to many people across the world and last a long time. The fact that this digital information can be access anytime is a digital mark itself. In addition to this, many of what I create are uploaded in onto my Github account thus anyone can download my creation and further alter it. 

Using Github, I have learn numerous things such as the imporance of documentations and keeping an organized online notebook. Initially using Github, I was unfamiliar with the way I was required to organize my notes. Even small factors such as making it into an .md file was all alien to me. My development and the growth of familiarity with Github can be seen throughout the modules as my notes became more precise, organized and well written.

This can be evident in my Github links as follows below:

The digital trace was not only evident in Github but also in Sketchfab and Twine as I have shared what I created on a public site. With Sketchfab, my model was made downloadable to the public and for anyone to search for it, they simply need to search my user or even the categories it is entered in. The similar can be said with my Module 3 Choose your own Adventure as I was required to share my creation on philome as a method in submitting this module. Once again, these two creation can be found online for number of years to come.

Lastly, throughout the course We were asked to create a hypothesis account in which we were required to annotate various passages which stood out to us in our weekly readings. While this was all posted within out class group, anyone within the group have the ability view the annotations and comment on this. In addition to this, the number of annotation, what I have posted and the article in which it is annotated are recorded within hypothesis. Despite my attempts in using Hypothesis weekly to keep up to date with my annotations, I do feel that I could have contributed more than I have done. Much like the initial issue I had with Github, I never highlighted my notes much less jot down what interested me online as I much prefered pen and paper. However, the more I have used hypothesis, the more I understood the value of using such program. Hypothesis enabled me to have discussion and to examine what others throught about the same article. 

This can be seen with the Hypothesis link as follows below:
