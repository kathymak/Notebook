Your evidence can include screenshots, links to files in your notebook, repo, paradata, process notes, hypothesis annotations... if you left digital traces, you can fold those into this final piece of work.

Throughout the four modules that was required within this course, I have documented my process, noted major themes that relate to what I create and all of this has left an over digital mark online. The first can be seen with the method in which all this is documented. Github could be made accessable to many people across the world and last a long time. The fact that this digital information can be access anytime is a digital mark itself. In addition to this, many of what I create are uploaded in onto my Github account thus anyone can download my creation and further alter it. This can be evident in my Github links as follows below:

https://github.com/kathymak/Notebook/tree/master/module2

https://github.com/kathymak/Notebook/tree/master/module%203

https://github.com/kathymak/Notebook/tree/master/module%204

The digital trace was not only evident in Github but also in Sketchfab and Twine as I have shared what I created on a public site. With Sketchfab, my model was made downloadable to the public and for anyone to search for it, they simply need to search my user or even the categories it is entered in. The similar can be said with my Module 3 Choose your own Adventure as I was required to share my creation on philome as a method in submitting this module. Once again, these two creation can be found online for number of years to come.
