i couldnt find the Women of Emancipation memorial but instead I had decided to do try making a model of a statue in parliament hill for the battle of 1812
tried two times
at the final attempt the model mapped in everything EXCEPT the statue 
it was getting cold and the workers around wanted to clean the statue so I had decided to leave, wonder around in hopes of finding another smaller one
I found a few, tried making models out of them but they just didnt turn out good, they were not recognizable at all
Decided to take a break inside Chapters by Rideau, do some research and warm up a bit
