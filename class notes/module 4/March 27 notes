are there any complications or assumptions that can complicate our module 4 just like the Palmyra arch?
since i am doing the hologram there can always be a chance for it to be altered inapppropriatly 
most of my modules are based around mythology and gods (besides the first one) so if I recreate a statue or artifact into the real world, it could be seen as "disrespectfu" or even misused
unintended consequences when you create things onine but there is a real oppertunity of damage when this then is created in real world
