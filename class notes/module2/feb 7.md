This week for the entry ticket, we had to read "Rethinking the Digital Remix: Mash‚Äêups and the Metaphysics of Sound Recording" by David J. Gunkel. At first glance, I initially thought this would be an incrediably interesting article asa I did take some music history courses at carleton in the past and touched upon the idea of remixing. 
A major theme present within this week's reading which I had discussed in my previous courses is the question whether remixing a song could be seen a inventing something new or if it is simply adding on to someone's work and calling it your own. 

"Advocates complain about the corporate appropriation and recall fondly the 'more original and authentic' past, while critics point out how this innovation is really nothing new and can be easily situated within the established order"
This is a quote from the deading by David Gunkel which is an example of the discourse surrounding the authenticity of remix. There is a constant idea that what was created in the past could be argue as better since there is a sense of originality, something that has never been done before and revolutionary which had large impact to society. However, we do not necessary see this in modern day anymore. 
Even when there is a new popular remix, I feel like this would always be compared to the past and will not achieve the same amount of praise as the original work which it was based off.
