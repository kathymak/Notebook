questions about ownership
who really owns a piece of artwork, is it the individual who it is reflects? the artist? the ones who buys the art?
could connect to my assignment as there is also a question of ownership when it comes to 3D modelling and this is especially confusing when you start to question who decides to depict a diety, deciding what they should look like
it is very interesting when you mix two artefacts from the past and it becomes new and revolutionary
I feel like you can also create ownership of an object by removing it from it's original context or environment and giving it a new meaning, this could possibly be seen with museums

"Objects are endlessly open and generous and that makes them vulnerable. Its the fact that they give out, give themselves up to us so fully that makes them so fragile, so often subjected to our will" 
Very interesting quote as it depicts how things are able to be changed, having the context altered will provide an entire new meaning
In a way, this would be reflected in my module 2 as I am taking two sculptures out of context and by mixing these two together I would be giving it a new context and meaning.


"Part autopsy, part memorial, these are new objects that record both their own existence and their own destruction. And in this they speak a truth about objects â€“ they are things that we bring into the world through the way in which we shape materials into cultural form but they are also things we destroy."
I think this quote can represent the consequences of 3D models. While it may be beneficial to educate the public, giving access for the public to view something they may never have the chance to, in a way this can also diminish the value of an artefact. Without 3D model technology, an object may be regarded as scared with only a select few to view the artefact. However with 3D model, due to the fact that the public has access to these information this transforms the artefact into a common everyday item where anyone can be able to view it.
