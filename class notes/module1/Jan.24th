talked about digital information vs actual information and the way it can be changed
cant help but think how in most museum now a days are often digitalized as they often have their artifacts online
also thought about how most people give you an audio recording guide when you tour through a historical site or museum
feeling of not as authentic personally because you are so focused on listening and messing with the device that you dont really take in your surroundings
In my opinion, it is not the same seeing something online compared to seeing soemthing in real life cause there is the sound scape, people interaction/reaction and even smell that all contribute to the experience not simply just the sight
I still would agree that this could help expose knowledge to the wider public regarding artifacts or general information that would otherwise be lost
This could relate to my model assignment as the sculpture of the individual is a mere imitation, the artist's perception of the man, I would be sure that if we saw him now a day, we might see him differently
digital information vs actual information and the way it can be changed could also be reflected within my model as this individual's complex public and private life is summarized into a short paragraph within a plaque displayed under the model bust
