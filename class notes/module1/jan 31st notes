When reading the article of Mount Vesusius it is interesting to me as the lack of something is more noticable than when it was there
made me think that generally, people do not notice what we do have but when something we are so used to is gone, that is when it is most studies or talked about 
graph of persistancy vs permeability allows us to map how easily an object could be changed
you move through the graph each time you reach a next time when there is a process in making something
corpse from the Mount Vesusius article are fleating and momentary as they dont last long and can very easily be changed 
each time a mould or cast is made or remade using a different material, it changes within the graph
could represent the change in original meaning or symbolism
This graph could be used for my model 
The process in making the bust could possibly be similar to creating the molds from the victims of Mount Vesusius but instead of starting off with a corpose (which is shown in the graph) the bust for my 3D model would have to start with a living indivudual
