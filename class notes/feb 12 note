talked about plaster casts
have to coat the model with some gel before putting on the cast so it can be removed later on
reminds me of the past where I have made cast by creating a mould first, filling the empty space with plaster and then taking it out or possibly even needing to glue it back together
they use cast for everything
use the cast to teach other artist what good art ish
museum problem.....prevent other people from making model of their work despite even if they might do it themselves
one a way to combat this is to dim the lights but besides that there isnt much to prevent it otherwise
biggest fear for digital object is the misuse
for example if u misuse the digital object it could impact another culture and they way they are precieved even if it is not the physical object
have to always ask if there is some damage when you do a mashup
