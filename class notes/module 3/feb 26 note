games as educational
reminds me of my thesis
could be used as an interactive learning tool
"not talk about guns but violent games"
always look for a link between games and agression but that has never been proven
however it can promote certain ideals and beliefs such as racism depending what community you decide to involve yourself into
player has to influence the environment
conflict just means there has to be a problem which has to be solved
the idea of saftey within game like rules
bioshock....consequences
ehtical chocies
for hsitorians, the chocies within the game have to matter especially when it represents real human beings so u can just go out shooting everyone
