had interview
archeogaming topic
weird concept of time like Fortnite where you only play for 15min per map but people still like to use it and build it
different idea of materialism
archeology of the mdoern day, captialism and online
more history and this side of things in indie games compared to AAA games where there has to be required guidelines in games to make it successful
also look at the archetect and building structure
games doesnt have to be historical to have archeogaming factors in it ecause players are always making and influencing the game world
could also look at reconstruction of games like assassin creed unity where it takes 2 years to recreate Notre Dame or a pillar in a game could be a stick so the context of the game matters not graphics
you treat an old console as a relic because it defines who you are and it is your childhood
would play a game differently depending on what console you play on....if it is emulator or not even if it is the same title
