Originally I had taken around 20 pictures using Scanned 3D using samsung s6 phone and I wasn't happy with the results.
The app had mapped everything in besides the actual model as it mainly focused on the background such as the buildings or railings. 
To fix this, I had decided to try my luck with another app so I had downloaded Regard3D with my Window laptop.
Next put in all my photo into a folder on my desktop and tried moving it into the program but it did not work as there was no meta-data within.
After giving up for few days, contemplating if i should return to downtown to try doing some more scanning as maybe it was simply my photos weren't good, I had decided to ask the professor for some help. 
Janurary 29th, 2017 after class I finally talk to the professor as I was very confused and lost as to my next steps or what I needed to do.
I set up a time that same day after class for an hour to talk with the professor and he had showed me what I needed to do with Regard3D which I found very helpful as I have minimal knowledge about coding. 
The professor had helped me through the coding and this was what was typed into the command prompt

During the meeting we had made a 3D model for my photograher statue, however the program had mapped in the backgroup more than the actual bust. 
I found this very interesting as I had tried my best to focus onto the statue within my photos.
