The object I chose to model was the Bust of Yousuf Karsh who was a prominent Canadian-Armenian photographer. This bust was given to Canada from the Armenian people for the 150th anniversary of Armenian-Canadian diplomatic relations. The location was to the side of Chateau Laurier on Rideau Street. 
I had chosen Yousuf Karsh as he was a very prominent individual within Ottawa, he has photographed some very important events and indivudal such as a bettween President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Mackenzie King. 
Through making the bust of this individual, I have come to learn more about his achievements and the reason why he was so well known within the city and the impact he has created. (Simon Gardner, CBCNews)
Not only have I learned more about this individual but also the process of created a 3D model of his bust. Through the process of creating this model, there were many trial and errors that had occured. While the steps that I had taken was recorded in another document within github, there were some key moments that I would like to point out. One major discovery that I would like to note while making this module was that the app used played a major role in creating the model. Originally I had used the android scanned 3D app to create the bust, while it was somewhat product was somewhat recognizable after three attempts, the model had shown up far more clearly when I had used regard3D program instead. 
Looking at the final product, I was very interested in the result of the model as it had seemed the program was very focused onto the background of the photos rather than the actual model itself. The background of bust location was simply a wall with railing, however regard3D had mapped in that railing more clearly than the actual bust itself. This was not the first time that the 3D modelling apps had mapped in the background. Both with regard3D and scanned3D had focused onto the background, mainly any with railing or Parliament Hill within the background. 
There were numerous times where my model would fail due to this especially using scanned3D.
