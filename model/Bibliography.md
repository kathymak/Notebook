There were a few sources that I had used when creating this model. One main source I had used was CBCNews as it gave me a bibliography regarding the individual which I had created for my assignment. As for the actual creation of the model, I mainly consulted with the professor (Shawn Graham) to help with the coding aspect of the assignment. The location of the bust was outside of Chateau Laurier on Rideau Street, Ottawa. Much like the numerous statues within downtown Ottawa, this statue can be viewed anytime by the public. The sculptor of this pieve is Megerditch Tarakdjian and the engineer behind this is Souren Hadjian, this information was displayed on a plaque just below the bust.
