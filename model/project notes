took around 20 pictures using Scanned 3D using samsung s6 phone. 
Mapped everything in besides the actual model
Downloaded Regard3D with Window laptop
put in all my photo into it but it did not work as there was no meta-data within
Gave up for few days, contemplating if i should return to downtown to try doing some more scanning as maybe it was simply my photos weren't good
Janurary 29th, 2017 after class I finally talk to the professor as I was very confused and lost as to my next steps or what I needed to do.
I set up a time that same day after class for an hour to talk with the professor and he had showed me what I needed to do with Regard3D which I found very helpful as I have minimal knowledge about coding. 
The professor had helped me through the coding and this was what was typed into the command prompt

During the meeting we had made a 3D model for my photograher statue, however the program had mapped in the backgroup more than the actual bust
I found this very interesting as I had tried my best to focus onto the statue within my photos.
While this 3D model is certainly recognizable, I might try doing another one of my own or even take a picture of the surrounding near parliament hill.
