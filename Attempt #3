Found a statue of Yousuf Karsh, a prominent Canadian - Armenian photographer
tried doing the model with scanned3D, worked twice but there were many missing spots that wasnt modeled in
the snow had picked up so maybe this could be a factor?
it felt like the scanned 3D was more focused on the background of the building rather than the actual statue
I ended with two models of the sculpture that was probably not recognizable but that was the best I could do
gave up and went home once the snow rolled in
