  There were a few sources that I had used when creating this model. One main source I had used was CBCNews as it gave me a bibliography regarding the individual which I had created for my assignment. As for the actual creation of the model, I mainly consulted with the professor (Shawn Graham) to help with the coding aspect of the assignment. I had not used any tutorial or website when trying to figure out the apps for the model as scanned3D for android had a built in tutorial which was very straightforward. As for Regard3D, I had tried to follow the instructions given by the professor for adding meta-data into the image.
  The location of the bust was outside of Chateau Laurier on Rideau Street, Ottawa. Much like the numerous statues within downtown Ottawa, this statue can be viewed anytime by the public. The sculptor of this pieve is Megerditch Tarakdjian and the engineer behind this is Souren Hadjian, this information was displayed on a plaque just below the bust. 
   Throughout this assignment, I did focus on two lectures within this module, one at the beginning of the course where we talked about the idea that 3D modeling and replicant of art allows the wider society experience or see something that they not not have a chance to. This applies to the bust which I have decided to model as the individual which the bust is modelled after has passed away for severl years thus the only way to experience and learn about this photographer is through his works, sculptures or books. Another lecture was kept in mind while building this model was the graph of persistency versus permeability from "Palimpsests of Immaterial Assemblages Taken outof Context: Tracing Pompeians from the Void into the Digital" reading. This is shown with the sculpture as through the creation of the sculpture. The individual can move along that graph as his life comes to an end but the he is immortalized through the creation of the sculpture.
