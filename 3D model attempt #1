went to the museum of science and technology to find some artifact for the assignment using scanned3D for andriod on Wednesday 17th, 2018
tried to 3D model a dog model with harness attached but the app stopped responding for some reason
tried again to scan a wooden frequency machine, took around 25 photo but the app failed to create the model around 70%
a stranger approached me questioning what i was doing with my phone and told me that the security worker at the museum requested that i delete all my photo but when i asked the front desk about this, they said that it should be fine and didnt know what happened in regards about that stranger who approached me
last attempt to make a model using a globe which was on display even though it was in a glass case, the model was successful. Only problem was that there were some areas not rendered in, maybe because i needed to adjust the angle when taking pictures as there was a wall in the way
the globe worked, there was only some holes in it and wasn't completely round
