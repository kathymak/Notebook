Emailed the professor to clarify some questions such as what kind of models I was suppose to make and if it needs to be historic or not
Today is Monday 22nd, January and I plan to wonder around downtown maybe around byward market as there are some historical sculptures I can scan
I plan on looking on the Women Emancipation Statue
