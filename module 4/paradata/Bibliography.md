For this module 4, I did not use much resources aside from a site from The Telegraph which gave me the instructions to create the hologram. From there, I also went onto Sketchfab onto my Module 2 and screenshoot my module using a phone in order to create the image needed to display onto the hologram.

Prior to the hologram I had attempted to use HP Aurasma but nothing successful came from this as the files would not be detected by the site. 

This last module was very short and we only had one class for the entry tickets for the readings so I had based most of my ideas and themes upon what was discussed within class rather than upon a specific reading which was what I have done in the past. I mainly drew on the invisible consequences and damage which can be caused by bringing a digital model into the real world and this was largely discussed on March 27th.
