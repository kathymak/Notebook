Once I had the hologram, I could more or less put any image onto this. Both Video and an image would display within my model
In order to create a photo for the hologram that can display at all side of the projector, I downloaded the free app on my Andriod S6 phone called "Holapex Hologram Video Maker" which was a free app that instantly duplicates any image or video into four exact image so that it can be displayed
I went on sketchfab and screenshot my Artemis and Nefertiti Module 2 remix, edit so that there is no UI interface seen within the picture
I opened "Holapex Hologram Video Maker", clicked create image and this duplicated the four image needed for the projector to display
I put the projector in the middle of the four duplicated photo and the image is shown within the hologram projector
