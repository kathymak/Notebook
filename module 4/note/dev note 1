Originally I decided to try and use Aurasma to create an AR experience
Opened the program and inserted a picture with dots as a trigger image
Could not get the 3D model into the program to connect with the trigger image
I needed DAE model
Went into Meshlab and exported my 3D model into .DAE format
Tried to insert it into the overlay 3D model as a way to connect it to the image, didnt work
I gave up and decided to create a Hologram instead
Went to the dollar store, bought 4 CD case, cutting knife and glue gun
Looked online for the dimension for the projector
I drew a rombus on a paper, the top is 1cm, both sides are 3.5 cm and the bottom is 6cm
I cut out 4 of this shape, placed it on the CD and traced the shape by scratching it out on the CD so that it is indented, indicating where to cut
I kept scratching at both side of the CD case where the rombus was drawn until it was thin enough to snap out
The entire rombus snapped in half because it wasnt enough to scratch it
Since part of it was already snapped out, I redrew the rombus but this time, one side will be where it previously snapped off
This time the entire rombus was able to be taken out without it breaking, maybe because the CD cover was already partially cut due to the first failed rombus
Repeat four times to get four of the sides
With a grid paper, I put the smaller end (1cm side) along one of the square in the grid and I glued the sides together 
After it is all glued, I tested the hologram out
One of the side was shorter than the other making the projector unsteady and the entire projector shape shifted because the angles were not accurate
to fix the shifting sides of the projector, I cut out two cardboard (6cm by 6cm) and glued it together to make it more thick 
I glued this to the wider end of the hologram project to stop it from moving it around every time it is picked up 
This solved the issue
To prevent the projector from falling on one side due to the unevent ends on the 1cm by 1cm side, I used the glue gun to fill in the difference of length and then used the knife to even it out
This fixed the unevenness of the hologram projector
Tested and  now all the issues are fixed
