downloaded Meshlab for Window 64
opened the program
clicked file and import mesh
this opened up a new window and I had to select my 3D model from module #1 and the obj. file was available to be imported
at first it says that there was an error and this file was not available as it could not be located
clicked next in the window
the program loaded a bit, stopped responding and once I waited a bit the 3D model of the bust I had made was loaded into the Meshlab
