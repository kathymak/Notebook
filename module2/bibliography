Throughout the making of this module, I had done numerous trial and errors while working with MeshMixer. The end result would not have been achievable without asking the professor for some help regarding exporting and combining the two objects together. In addition to the professor's help I had also used one online forum to figure out how to get the texture package and a youtube video tutorial showing me how to mix the two objects together. All of this was done with one main article from class kept in mind and this was Sam Jacob's "The copy in contemporary culture is both despised and feared" from February 14.

The First model which I had decided to use for my project the statue of the Greek goddess "Artemis with Ifigenia" and remix it with the bust of Queen Nefertiti. I had obtained this 3D model of Artemis with Ifigenia through Sketchfab as the original model is located in Copenhagen, Denmark which can be viewed in the Statens Museum of Kunst as a part of the Royal Cast collection. The second model which I decided to combine with Artemis and Ifigenia is the bust of Queen Nefertiti which is located in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.
