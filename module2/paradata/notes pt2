Upon trying to alter the original bust, I had found it too small and fragmented to do anything
I have talked with the professor in the past and he says that I could use 3D model from sketchfab if I had liked 
Looked around sketchfab and I had found a statue of Artemis and Ifigenia, I was very interested in this as Artemis was one of the Greek gods I had studied in the past which means I have knowledge of her
I had downloaded this 3D model from https://sketchfab.com/models/fb439a554d0644bc9dae735d39886e9b#
once I had the file, I opened Meshlab to start importing my data into that program
When i clicked "Import Mesh" from the file option in the top, there was nothing that showed up within the file that I just downloaded
I quickly realized that this was a zip file so I right clicked onto each folder to extract all
Once that is done, i had tried clicking "import Mesh" within Meshlab and selected the obj. file
This time the file had loaded in,  all I need is to find another model I would like to mix it with
I am thinking a old catholic statue depicting something holy or even some sort of angel
I would like to remix these two as these two figures would represent a godly, religious figure
Furthermore, Artemis is the god of the hunt but also the protector of children and feminine traits in general which was highly worshipped. 
The reason as to why this model could be seen in moden day is the idea we see society embrace their identity and sexuality. We also see a femininist movement and I think this parallels the symbolism of Artemis even though it may be through a different means or motive.
