The two objects I had decided to mix together is a statue of the Greek goddes Artemis with Ifigenia and the head of Queen Nefertiti. 

Artemis with Ifigenia
This statue was a 3D model taken from Sketchfab but the original model is located in Copenhagen, Denmark. It can be viewed in the Statens Museum of Kunst as a part of the Royal Cast collection. Artemis is a Greek goddess of the hunt, femininity with the power heal or harm. The other individual depicted within the statue, Ifigenia, who represents strength. Even the name Ifigenia means "born to strength". Looking at this statue as a whole, it depicts the mythology of Artemis and Ifigenia as the tale describes the goddess to save Ifigenia just as she was being sacrificed. 


Queen Nefertiti 
Meanwhile the Queen Nefertiti's bust is located in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. This queen was said to be the embodiment of beauty with the power to rule over Egypt as she was considered to be one of the most powerful rulers. 

I had decided to remix these two models as these individuals depicted within their respected models have very similar attributes and what they represent. Due to the fact that Artemis is a goddess which symbolize femininity and power, Nerfertiti could be seen to personify those traits as a ruler of Egypt. 

While mixing the two models together, I had made sure there was enough symbolism within the model to give an indication as to each character depicted. While Nerfertiti replaced Artemis' head within the model, a stag could be seen beside the body. This stag plays a significant role as it is one of the major symbolism used to represent Artemis within the Greek lore. Next, the character Ifigenia was kept to demonstrate the strength which both Artemis and Nerfertiti both held. Not only did  Ifigenia display strength towards both individual but it can also symbolize the idea of being saved and ruled by someone more powerful.
