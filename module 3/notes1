Downloaded Twine for Windows
double clicked the first window to edit the start of my story
named it "start" and deleted all the previous text that was written in by default
used '' insert text here '' to start off my story in the first section to tell a back story
after writting the introduction to the story, i put [[ next ]] to continue the story
put in the beginning of the backstory explaining who you are and the situation then continued it with [[ what are the rumours? ]]
expanded on the story and split the story into two choices, [[ investigate at night]]  [[investigate in the day ]]
tried to add a random dice rolling factor for the [[investigate in the day ]]
Looked it out from the twine cook book and used  <<print random(1,4) >> from sugarcube and this didnt work, this text just showed up exactly how the code was
Looked back at the twine cook book and used  (random: 1, 100) and this gave me a random number so this worked
