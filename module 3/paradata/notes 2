I decided to move (random: 1, 100) into the next slide so i can expand on this story
Split the story into two section using the random dice roll, 1-40 would continue the story thus ensuring survival for now but 41-100 would end the story 
put in [[ go on ]] for the 41-100 story section
split the story into two again with [[approach them, they are merchants]] and [[ ignore and hide, they are grave robbers]]
created the first ending from fatigue and dehydration 
Worked on the other option when the strangers are merchants and gave a section where the character lives and explore at night
merge with one of the initial choices near the beginning of the story where you choose to set out looking for the artifact in the day or night.
