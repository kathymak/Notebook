I decided to move (random: 1, 100) into the next slide so i can expand on this story
Split the story into two section using the random dice roll, 1-40 would continue the story thus ensuring survival for now but 41-100 would end the story 
put in [[ go on ]] for the 41-100 story section
split the story into two again with [[approach them, they are merchants]] and [[ ignore and hide, they are grave robbers]]
