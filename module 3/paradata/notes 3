Created the new story for rolling below 40 during the random dice roll
split the story into two [[ approach it]] and [[don't approach it]] when you see the hazey pyramid in the distane
Merge [[Dont approach it]] from this story line with [[Keep Walking ]] from the [[Hide and Ignore them, they are grave robbers]] option
Second ending made through this merging
Created a section to allow the character to enter the pyramid using [[enter pyramid]] that can be done by clicking the [[appoach it]] story line choice
New section for the beginning to start going out to investigate at night and built on the story
Merge the daytime line of approaching the merchants and resting at night with the beginning of the story where you initially choose to explore nightime in the first place
