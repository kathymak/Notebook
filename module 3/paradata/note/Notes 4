Once you enter the pyramid, you are given two option [[Descent lower into the pyramid]] which will let you progress
[[Continue walking towards the dripping noise]] will lead you to a damp room filled with jars and treasures but this might also lead to game over if you decide to loot the jars and treasure
Created an option to not loot the chests from the treasure trap room and merge it with the story, leading down towards the basement of the pyramid
combine the two story line from initially deciding to go down the stairs and not looting the room
Start of the end game sequence with [[proceed]]
Created the next section where you are faced with a long passage. there is the option to [[Hug the wall and walk through the passage]] where nothing happens and you continue to story
Second option is [[Run through it as fast as you can ]] where you hear a click but nothing happens, you continue
In the last area of the game, you have the option to [[Look inside the Queen's coffin]] where this will inflict a curse on the queen and end the game
Second option is [[Search the room]] where you will find the artifact near a statue and you will be given more options
Once you search the room, the statue will come to life as you pick up the artifact, giving you two final choices
[[Grab the bow and run]] will be game over
[[put back the bow ]] will let you live and have the power from the maiden (Ifigenia) which represents strength and bravery hence the good ending
